Graph 1:
    -> total probes to fill(or not) hash table
    -> x-axis: size of table
    -> y-axis: number of probes
    -> line-graph: type of probing function

graph 2
    -> average probes per insertion 
    -> x-axis: size of table
    -> y-axis: number of probes
    -> line-graph: type of probing function

Graph 3-7
    -> probes at a given load factor
    -> one graph per size of table
    -> x-axis: load factor
    -> y-axis: number of probes
    -> line-graph: type of probing function
