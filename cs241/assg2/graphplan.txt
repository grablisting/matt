graph 1
    -> average probes per insertion 
    -> x-axis: size of table
    -> y-axis: number of probes
    -> line-graph: type of probing function

Graph 2-6
    -> probes at a given load factor
    -> one graph per size of table
    -> x-axis: load factor
    -> y-axis: number of probes
    -> line-graph: type of probing function
